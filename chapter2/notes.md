# Chapter 2: No framework, no panic

## Frameworks vs JavaScript

### Why to use a framework?

* Cross-browser compatibility
* Code simplification (e.g.: AJAX calls, DOM manipulation...)
* Access to future features of JavaScript not yet supported by all browsers

### Why you should still learn JavaScript first?

* Every framework uses JavaScript under the hood --> Good to have an idea of what you're actually doing ;)
* Better for small libraries/components:
  * Portable (easier to adapt to any other application)
  * Saves bandwidth

## Frameworks

### jQuery

* Adds a $ object to the global scope with a bunch of methonds in it

*Code examples:*

jQuery | JavaScript
------ | ----------


### Underscore / Lodash

### Backbone / Ember / Angular / React
